<h2>Subscriptions and Billing .</h2>

<p>Subscription Plans and Policies . Please see Subscribe  for a description of the current subscription plans and prices. Please note that the Subscription Policies that are disclosed to you in subscribing to the Services are deemed part of these Terms. Please see Billing Details for a description of such policies. For the purposes of these Terms, the term "Member" includes subscribers, unless usage indicates otherwise. From time to time, we may remove the profiles of non-subscribers.</p>

<p>Billing . We use a third-party payment processor (the "Payment Processor") to bill you through an online account (your " Billing Account") for use of the Services as a subscriber. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms. We are not responsible for error by the Payment Processor. By subscribing, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of the Services in accordance with the subscription plan that you have selected using your Billing Account, and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your "Payment Method"). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.</p>

Payment Method . The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.</p>

Recurring Billing . Most subscription plans to the Services consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a recurring subscription plan, you acknowledge that your subscription has an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO  ACCOUNT SETTINGS.</p>

Current Information Required . YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT ACCOUNT SETTINGS. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF THE SERVICE UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FOR THE SERVICE AS SET FORTH ABOVE.</p>

Change in Amount Authorized. If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.</p>

Auto-Renewal . Unless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done through your Account Settings, your subscription to the Services will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional subscription rate. To change or resign your subscription at any time, go to Account Settings. If you terminate your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you won't be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period.</p>

Reaffirmation of Authorization . Your non-termination or continued use of the Services reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially subscribed to the Services.</p>

Free Trials and Other Promotions. Any free trial or other promotion that provides subscriber-level access to the Services must be used within the specified time of the trial. You must cancel your subscription before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged a subscription fee. If you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a subscription, please contact us at support@yumixo.com.</p>

Mobile Applications . Mobile functionality of the Services may be provided for free, but please be aware that your carrier's normal rates and fees, such as message and data rates, may still apply and you are solely responsible for those fees. To the extent necessary, in the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you agree that you will update your account information within 48 hours to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person who acquires your old number.</p>

Interaction with Us or Our Agents . We may provide assistance and guidance to users and Members through our employees or agents. When communicating with those individuals, you may not be abusive, obscene, profane, offensive, sexist, threatening, harassing, racially offensive, or otherwise behave inappropriately. If we feel that your behavior toward any of our customer care representatives or other employees is at any time threatening or offensive, we reserve the right to immediately terminate your membership.</p>
